# MVF Tech Test - Favourite Programming Language

# The Task

**Github (API) test**

We would like you to build a web or command line application,which should allow users to enter an arbitrary Github username,and be presented with a best guess of the Github user's favourite programming language. This can be computed by using the Github API to fetch all of the user's **public** Github repositories, each of which includes the name of the dominant language for the repository. Documentation for the Github API can be found at https://developer.github.com/v3/

You may use any programming language, framework, or library.

# Technologies Used
- Javascript
- HTML

# Process/Whiteboarding

I whiteboarded all the processes/things to be thinking about for this task. Check the image below for this

This included 
- [x] Getting user input for Api Address
- [x] What the response data Oject looks like, I used postman for this  
- [x] Design
- [x] Testing
- [x] EdgeCases

# User Stories

```
As a user
So I can find someone's Github profile
I'd like to able enter and search for a particular Github username
```

```
As a user 
so I can find out what someones favourite programming language is
I'd like to click a button which returns the selected users favourite programming language(s). Which are displayed to the current screen
```

# Edge Cases 
- [x] Github User has no Repos
- [x] Github user has undetermined language of choice (null)
- [x] User inputs invalid Github Username


# Improvements/Future Features
- Github Avatar
- Mocking of Api
- Pop out card for displaying information with Avatar, Username, favourite Language
- Deploy to Netlify afer completing these improvements

# Design Idea
Used a simple HTML for the webpage design and the code for the ogic is embedded as a Javascript within the HTML


# Running locally and Setup
1. Clone this repository
2. Run the Homepage.html using any browser
